# photosint

OSINT tool for images.

Chrome extension that checks all images _while browsing_ for EXIF data.

Also gives context options for reverse image search in different search engines.

### TODO

- fix bug where EXIF.geData does not respond anything (example: google images and then scroll down)
- show some exif data on top of elements, fix UI
